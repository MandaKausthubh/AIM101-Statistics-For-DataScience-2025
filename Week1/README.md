# Week 1: Installation and Introduction

## Installation:
Ensure that you have the following installed:

1. Conda (optional)
2. Python Libraries:
    a. Numpy and JAX
    b. Pandas and CuDF
    c. Matplotlib and Seaborn
3. Jupyter Notebook
4. R and R studio

NOTE: You can work without any of these if you have the a verified Kaggle account: https://www.kaggle.com/ 

## Introduction 1: Jupyter Notebooks
You can create a notebook either in a jupyter or on kaggle.
To create a notebook on Jupyter:

1. Type the following in your terminal: jupyter notebook
2. The step above will open up a tab in your default browser, with jupyter open.
3. Go to file > New > Notebook.
4. Jupyter works on your local machine, but note that if your machine doesn't have a GPU with a working CUDA driver all the programs might not work. 

To create a notebook on kaggle:
1. Click on "create" (also the big blue "+" sign on your right) > New Notebook.
2. This will create a python notebook.
3. Ensure that you activate a GPU(available only if you have verified account): Settings > Accelerator > (Select the GPU you want).

## Introduction to Numpy and JAX:
You can refer to and play around the file: ./numpy-and-jax-tutorial-v2.ipynb
You can then read the following tutorials:
Numpy: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html 
JAX: https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html 

## Introduction to Pandas:
You can refer to and play with the notebook: https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html 
You can also read the tutorials:
Pandas: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/index.html 
CuDF (Covered next week): https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/index.html 

I also encourage you to look around Kaggle to see all the feature out!!
